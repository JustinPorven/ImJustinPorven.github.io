                <h1>Justin Andrew Porven</h1>
                <p>I am an entry-level programmer 
                   looking to make a mark in the tech industry.
                   I have<br /> always been fascinated by the power of 
                   technology to change the world, and programming<br /> 
                   provides me a way to be a part of that change. 
                   From a young age, I have always been<br /> intrigued by 
                   puzzles and problem-solving. As a child, 
                   I spent hours playing with toys and games<br /> that challenged 
                   me to think critically and creatively to find solutions.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>When I discovered programming, I found that it combined 
                    my love for problem-solving with<br /> my interest in technology. 
                    Programming presented me with a new set of challenges to 
                    overcome,<br /> from debugging errors to optimizing code for efficiency. 
                    I am continually inspired by the limitless<br /> possibilities of 
                    what can be achieved through programming and the power of technology<br /> 
                    to solve some of the world's most pressing issues.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    I am currently completing my degree in computer programming and have 
                    gained experience<br /> in various programming languages such as 
                    C++, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While my academic<br /> background has given 
                    me a solid foundation in programming, I am eager to learn and 
                    grow further in this field.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Thank you for taking the time to read about me. I look forward to exploring<br /> 
                    and learning from opportunities in the programming field.
                </p>
